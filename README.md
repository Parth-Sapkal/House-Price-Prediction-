 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning regression model. It showcases end-to-end data science workflow including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and a simple web application for real-time predictions.

📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed real estate dataset
- Outlier removal and feature transformation
- Location-based encoding for high cardinality features
- Multiple regression models tested (Linear, Lasso, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Best model selected based on RMSE and cross-validation
- Integrated with a web app using Flask/Streamlit for interactive predictions

🧠 Technologies Used

Languages:Python  
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
Web Framework: Flask or Streamlit (optional deployment)  
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset includes features such as:

- Location  
- Square footage (`total_sqft`)  
- Number of bedrooms (`BHK`)  
- Number of bathrooms  
- Price (in lakhs)  

> Source: Kaggle or real estate listing websites

🔍 Model Evaluation

- Trained and evaluated multiple models using RMSE and R² score
- Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Final model tested with user input via a web interface

🌐 Web Application

A user-friendly web interface is created where users can enter:

- Location  
- Square footage  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of bathrooms  

and get an estimated house price.

 ▶️ To run locally:
